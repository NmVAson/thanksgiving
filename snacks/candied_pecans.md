# Candied Pecans
Prep Time 10 minutes  
Total Time 55 minutes  
Servings 4 cups  

## Ingredients
1/2 cup granulated sugar  
1/2 cup light brown sugar  
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon  
1 teaspoon salt  
16 ounces about 4 cups unsalted pecans halves  
1 egg white  
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1 teaspoon water 

# Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with a Silpat baking mat or parchment paper and set aside.
1. In a medium bowl, add sugars, cinnamon, and salt. Whisk until combined. Set aside.
1. In a large bowl, whisk the egg white, vanilla, and water together until frothy. Add the pecans and gently toss until the pecans are well coated. Add the sugar and cinnamon mixture and toss until pecans are covered.
1. Spread the pecans out in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake for about 40-45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes. The sugar mixture will harden on the pecans.
1. Remove from the oven and let the pecans cool on the baking sheet. When completely cool, store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
