## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 300°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside.
1. Clean the pumpkin seeds by removing them from the pumpkin, and then picking any large chunks out.
1. Fill a medium-size mixing bowl with warm water. Add in the pumpkin seeds, and then swirl around with your hand or a spoon to dislodge any of the pumpkin "gunk." Let rest for five minutes. The pumpkin seeds will float to the top, and the pumpkin guts will sink to the bottom.
1. Use a slotted spoon to remove the clean pumpkin seeds to a kitchen towel and pat dry.
1. In a small bowl, mix together your seasoning mixture of choice, if using.
1. Toss the clean and towel-dried pumpkin seeds with the olive oil. Then, add in the seasoning mixture, if using, or just salt to taste, tossing to make sure each pumpkin seed is well-coated.
1. Spread pumpkin seeds onto the prepared baking sheet, making sure they are in one even layer. If you need to move to a second baking sheet, do so.
1. Roast in preheated oven for 20-30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, or until the pumpkin seeds are golden brown.
1. Remove from heat and let cool completely (pumpkin seeds will crisp up as they cool).

## How do you clean pumpkin seeds before roasting?
To clean pumpkin seeds, here’s what you’ll need to do:

1. Scoop all your pumpkin seeds out from the pumpkin. I like to lay them out on a clean kitchen towel or newspaper.
1. Pick any large chunks of pumpkin “guts” out and compost (or do like we do, and feed it to your chickens). 
1. Once you have the seeds mostly separated, fill up a big bowl with warm water and dunk in the seeds. Use your hand to swirl them around a bit to loosen any pumpkin guts remaining. Then, let the seeds rest for about five minutes or so. In those five minutes, magic happens! The seeds all float, and the remaining pumpkin guts sink.
1. Fish out the seeds using your hands, a slotted spoon, or a sieve, and then put them onto a dish towel and pat dry. You now have clean seeds ready to be roasted!

## Boil pumpkin seeds
Speed up the process by instead boiling pumpkin seeds in salted filtered water. 
1. Bring a saucepan of filtered water (1 tablespoon salt per quart of water) to a rolling boil, and then 
1. add the cleaned pumpkin seeds and boil for 10 minutes. 
1. Remove from the water, 
1. towel dry, and then roast as directed—you may need to add 5-10 minutes worth of cooking time to get properly crunchy pumpkin seeds.
