30 to 40 biscotti, depending on size

## Ingredients
4 tablespoons (57g) softened butter, salted or unsalted  
2/3 cup (131g) granulated sugar  
1 1/4 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, or 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon plus 1/4 teaspoon each ground nutmeg and ground ginger  
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon salt (see "tips," below)  
1 large egg  
1/2 cup (113g) pumpkin purée  
2 cups (241g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour  
coarse white sparkling sugar and/or cinnamon-sugar for topping, optional  

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) one large (about 18" x 13") baking sheet.
1. In a medium-sized bowl, beat the softened butter, sugar, spices, baking powder, and salt until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
1. Beat in the egg and pumpkin purée. At low speed of your mixer, add the flour, stirring until smooth; the dough will be sticky.
1. Scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Divide it in half, and shape it into two 10" x 2 1/2" logs. Pat the logs into long rectangles, and smooth their tops and sides; a wet spatula or wet bowl scraper works well here.
1. Sprinkle with coarse white sparkling sugar and/or cinnamon-sugar, if desired, pressing it in gently.
1. Bake the dough for 25 minutes. Remove it from the oven.
1. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.
1. Wait 5 minutes, then use a sharp chef's knife or serrated knife to cut the log crosswise into 1/2" to 3/4" slices. Or cut the biscotti on the diagonal, for fewer, longer biscotti. As you're slicing, be sure to cut straight up and down, perpendicular to the pan; if you cut unevenly, biscotti may be thicker at the top than the bottom, and they'll topple over during their second bake.
1. Set the biscotti on edge on the prepared baking sheet. Return the biscotti to the oven, and bake them for 40 to 45 minutes, until they're starting to turn golden brown around the edges. They'll still feel quite soft in the middle. Turn off the oven, crack the door open a couple of inches, and let the biscotti cool right in the oven.
1. Remove the biscotti from the oven when they're completely cool. Store airtight at room temperature for several days; freeze, well-wrapped, for longer storage.
