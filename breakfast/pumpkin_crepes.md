# Harvest Spice Pumpkin Crepes with Cinnamon Cream Filling

## Ingredients
### Crepes
2 eggs
1/4 cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)
1 cup milk
1/4 cup water (if making gluten free increase the water to 1/2 cup)
1 cup flour (regular or gluten free flour)
1/2 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp Pumpkin Pie Spice
1/2 tsp cinnamon

### Cinnamon Cream
1 cup softened cream cheese
2 tsp sugar

## Instructions
Whisk all of the crepe ingredients in a bowl and chill for 1 hour.
Place the cream cheese in a bowl and using a hand mixer, whip until light and airy ~2 minutes.
Add in the sugar and cinnamon and beat until creamy.
Slowly add in the milk until desired consistency. You want this thick but spreadable. Taste for sweetness/cinnamon.
Place in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
Spray cooking spray lightly in a Crepe Pan or Electric Crepe Pan over medium heat.
Pour 2 ounces of batter in the center of the pan and swirl around in circles to spread evenly. *If making gluten free, you will have to spread this out with a rubber tipped spatula)
Cook for 30 seconds to a minute on one side (until lightly golden).
Flip and cook for 15 seconds.
Plate and repeat.
To serve spread a Tbl of cinnamon cream on the lower quarter of the crepe.
Fold in half and half again.
